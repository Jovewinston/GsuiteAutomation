If instruction is vague, explained implicitly, or lack key information for the web agent, please add clarifying keywords or add more details relevant to the page to clarify the instruction 
For example:
For pages maps or flights that involves navigation, transport, or routes, you should include explicit methods or modes and clear location endpoints if implied (e.g., 'by car', 'by walking', 'from Seattle to San Francisco').
For pages like maps, calendar, or flights you should add clear timing (e.g., 'right now', 'form May 12 to May 23', 'at 12 pm', etc.).
You should also use explicit UI verbs relevant to the page (e.g., 'open', 'search', 'navigate', 'send', 'compose')
IMPORTANT: If includes personal information like name, address, or contact details of a person, replace with a realistic placeholder
Example: 'email my mom' -> 'send a message to mom@example.com' or 'share my calendar with my friend' -> 'share your calendar with sam@example.com'
If instruction includes an animate noun or references to a group of people, replace it with a random generic name/s or generate contact details if needded
Example: 'invite my team to a progress check meeting' -> 'send an event invitation to sam@example.com, john@example.com, and jane@example.com'
If instruction is too complex, you can just focus on the simple but most important part of the instruction

If instruction is vague, explained implicitly, or lack key information for the web agent, please add clarifying keywords or add more details relevant to the page to clarify the instruction .

Your responsibilities:
1. Always include explicit transportation mode (e.g., 'by car', 'by walking', 'by public transit', 'by bicycle')
2. Always specify clear location endpoints:
   - For directions: 'from [start] to [destination]'
   - For single location: use specific landmarks or addresses
3. Use explicit UI verbs (e.g., 'search for directions', 'find route', 'get walking directions', 'locate')

Examples:
- 'find a way to the airport' -> 'search for directions from current location to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport by car'
- 'get to central park' -> 'find walking directions from Times Square to Central Park'
- 'find a coffee shop' -> 'search for coffee shops within 1 mile of current location'
- 'how long to get to work' -> 'calculate driving time from home to office at 9:00 AM on Monday'
- 'Identify the traffic condition on I-5 South' -> 'check current traffic conditions on the I-5 South route to seatac airport'

IMPORTANT:
- If the prompt asks about road conditions (e.g., "I-5 South"), rewrite it with realistic endpoints (e.g., "from University District to SeaTac Airport") to simulate traffic.
  (e.g. task: "What is traffic like on I-5?" -> "Check traffic conditions on the I-5 South route from university district to seatac airport.")
- If location is vague, you can choose replace it with a random generic location that is relevant to the task.
- If transportation mode is not specified, default to 'by car' if its far, and by walking if its close
- For location searches, include radius or area constraints if relevant
